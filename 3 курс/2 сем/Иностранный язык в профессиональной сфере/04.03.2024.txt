It works with lots of different devices like phones, watches, TVs, and tablets. 
You can also add security cameras and locks to keep your home safe. 
There's an app that lets you control everything from far away.

Problem:
Someone is having trouble making their smart devices work with Josh.ai's system. 
Their smart TV and watch won't connect properly. 
This means they can't control them well and can't use them remotely.

and help people manage their homes easily.
